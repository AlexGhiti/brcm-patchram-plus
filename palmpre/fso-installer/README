fso-installer - A small utility to install a FSO/SHR image on the Palm Pre device
==================================================================================

Cause we are lacking a real flash process on the palm pre device currently we have
work around this with using the novacom utility from palm. The fso-installer 
utility is using novacom to flash a .tar.gz rootfs image or a uImage kernel image 
to the device and to help with the lvm resize process. 

1. Preparation

First to use the fso-installer we need two things:

- novacom (developer.palm.com)
- webos doctor (1.4.5 is the last tested version) (see webos-internals wiki)

Put the webos-doctor file in the downloads directory and you are ready to move on.


2. Resize LVM partition layout

If you already did this manually, skip this step and move on to 3. Otherwise you have
to put your device in recover mode (power off the devie, hold volume up and put in the
usb cable connected to a computer). If your device is in recover mode type:

# make memload

This loads the nova installer from webOS into device ram and execute it. Now type the 
following to backup all files on the device (including the very important device tokens):

# make backup

This creates a backup/ folder in the current directory which contains one subdirectory per
device you connect. One device is identified by it's internal id. In the device directory
will be after the backup process several files which contains the data from the device.
This are:
- rootfs.tar.gz
- mmcblk0p1.bak (full binary dump of the /dev/mmcblk0p1 partition (contains bootloader, nvram and tokens))
- varfs.tar.gz
- boot.tar.gz
- media.tar.gz

How long the backup process takes depends on how much data you have on the media partition
of your pre device.

After you have done the backup we now want to resize the LVM partition layout to get some
free space for FSO/SHR. To archive this there is the 'lvm-resize' make target. Execute it
with (if you want to change to resulting size of the new create fso lvm partition edit the
config.mk file and change the CONFIG_WEBOS_MEDIA_TARGET_SIZE variable to a lower value):

# make lvm-resize

This should take some time including reformatting the media partition (this means if you
want to use webos afterwards you have to restore the webOS media partition before you boot
into webos, see chapter "X. Restore webOS media partition from backup")
