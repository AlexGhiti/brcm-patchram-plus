	android: mkbootimg: add --pagesize command line argument

2011-08-26  Bob Ham  <rah@bash.sh>

	Add a utility, unbootimg (v3)
	This program is the complement to mkbootimg.  It prints header
	information and extracts kernel, ramdisk and 2nd boot images.

	The second version was absent trailing whitespace, as per comments
	from GNUtoo.  This third version includes two changes: correcting
	the file name at the top of unbootimg.c and also changing the text
	"image size" to "total image size" in the header printing.  It
	also includes the S-o-b line below, also as per comments from
	GNUtoo.
